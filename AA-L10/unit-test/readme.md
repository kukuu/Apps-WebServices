## PHPUnit 


This is a simple example of unit testing in PHP with PHPUnit. I have increased the scope of the application by adding email address to the Various Actors which I am  using as Test cases.


If you succeed at that, then try taking a test driven development approach to adding a new method to `Average` for calculating the modal average by writing a test first.

## Getting Started


Clone this repository and then run Composer:-

```
composer install
```

You will then be able to run the unit tests using:-

```
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```
