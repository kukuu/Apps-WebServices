## PHPUnit 

This is a simple example of unit testing in PHP with PHPUnit. I have increased the scope of the application by adding email address to the Various Actors which I am  using as Test cases.

## Getting Started

Clone this https://github.com/kukuu/Apps-WebServices/tree/master/AA-L10 ,repository and then run Composer:-

```
composer install
```

You will then be able to run the unit tests using:-

```
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```
