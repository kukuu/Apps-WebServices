## Understanding beyound REST, RESTful & Web Services

 Web service facilitates interaction between two machines over a network. An API acts as an interface between two different applications so that they can communicate with each other.
 Web service also uses SOAP, REST, and XML-RPC as a means of communication.
 
 Representational state transfer (REST) is a style of software architecture. REST is an "architectural style" that
 basically exploits the existing technology and protocols of the Web. 
 
 RESTful is typically used to refer to web services implementing such an architecture. A web API is a development in web services where emphasis has been moving to simpler representational state transfer (REST) based communications. 
 Restful APIs do not require XML-based web service protocols (SOAP and WSDL) to support their interfaces.
