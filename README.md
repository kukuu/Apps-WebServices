# WebServices & REST 

Understanding beyound REST, RESTful & Web Services

## Web Services

 Web service facilitates interaction between two machines over a network. An API acts as an interface between two different applications so that they can communicate with each other.
Web service also uses SOAP, REST, and XML-RPC as a means of communication.
 
 ```
 Web service is a standardized medium to propagate communication between the client and server applications on the World Wide Web. eXamples are:

WSDL (Web Services Description Language), SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), RDF (Resource Description Framework), and RSS.

A web service is a software module which is designed to perform a certain set of tasks.

The web services can be searched for over the network and can also be invoked accordingly.
When invoked the web service would be able to provide functionality to the client which invokes that web service.

In a Webservice architecture the client would invoke a series of web service calls via requests to a server which would host the actual web service.

These requests are made through what is known as remote procedure calls. Remote Procedure Calls(RPC) are calls made to methods which are hosted by the relevant web service.

As an example, Amazon provides a web service that provides prices for products sold online via amazon.com. The front end or presentation layer can be in .Net or Java but either programming language would have the ability to communicate with the web service.

The main component of a web service is the data which is transferred between the client and the server, and that is XML. XML (Extensible markup language) is a counterpart to HTML and easy to understand the intermediate language that is understood by many programming languages.

So when applications talk to each other, they actually talk in XML. This provides a common platform for application developed in various programming languages to talk to each other.

Web services use something known as SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) for sending the XML data between applications. The data is sent over normal HTTP. The data which is sent from the web service to the application is called a SOAP message. The SOAP message is nothing but an XML document. Since the document is written in XML, the client application calling the web service can be written in any programming language.


Benefits

1. Web services can help to solve the interoperability problem by giving different applications a way to link their data.

2. Provide reusable application-components. ie. currency conversion, weather reports, or even language translation as services.

3. Connect existing software.

 ## REST & RESTful
 
 Representational state transfer (REST) is a style of software architecture. REST is an "architectural style" that
 basically exploits the existing technology and protocols of the Web. 
 
 RESTful is typically used to refer to web services implementing such an architecture. A web API is a development in web services where emphasis has been moving to simpler representational state transfer (REST) based communications. 
 Restful APIs do not require XML-based web service protocols (SOAP and WSDL) to support their interfaces.
